I propose the following tests:

*1. reblog followed at some distance by reblog-delete, but in the same pack of blocks during initial sync
*2. like above but both in the same block, preferably during live sync
*3. like 1. followed by renewed reblog of the same post, still in the same pack of blocks
*4. like 2. followed by renewed reblog of the same post, still in the same live block
*5. reblog then reblog-delete during initial sync but in separate packs of blocks
*6. reblog during initial sync, reblog-delete during live sync
*7. both reblog and reblog-delete in separate live blocks
*8. reblog/reblog-delete authorized by someone other than blogger (two versions: unrelated account or post author that is not the same account as blogger)
*9. reblog-delete of post that never existed
10. reblog-delete of post that was deleted in the same pack of initial sync blocks, 
*11. reblog-delete of post that was deleted in different packs, 
*12. reblog-delete of post that was deleted operation in live block while delete in initial sync, 
*13. reblog-delete of post that was deleted both in live blocks - same
*14. reblog-delete of post that was deleted both in live blocks - different
